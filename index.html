                    My name is Hunter Leavitt and I am a recent graduate of the University of Utah, having majored in Computer Science and minored in Business.
                    I initially studied Finance when beginning my undergraduate degree before pivoting to Computer Science about a year in. This decision came
                    as a result of my self-study of the Python language, where I utilized the text by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_Shaw">Shaw</a>,
                    <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em>, as my guide (a resource I still personally recommend for new learners with the official course accessible <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">here</a>).
                    True to that texts' name, I came to the realization that I was indeed learning about computing the "hard way" and decided to make my studies official
                    in order to bolster my efforts, pivoting hard into STEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you've got some context on the path I've taken leading to the present, I'd like to share some of my interests with you; I am a deeply inquisitive
                    individual and an avid reader, in love with hard sci-fi novels. If I am not reading such novels, then you are likely to find me reading non-fiction historical
                    accounts. I also enjoying making things, engaging in hobbyist-level fabrication of personal physical goods with my trusty 3D printer, an internet connection, 
                    and the miracle of cheap piecemeal electronics. Lastly, I enjoy being something of a tourist and partaking in activities enjoyed by the ones I love, such as climbing
                    with my partner or playing tennis with my grandfather.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, to give something of a succinct value statement, I believe that computing is a miraculous development that should be accessible for all Humans. Through
                    computing, people can obtain education on subjects they may not otherwise be exposed to; a parent can ascertain the status of their child in a moment of uncertainty
                    from thousands of kilometers away, with a level of difficulty nearly commensurate with basic thought and speech. It is for the bolstering and continuance of those ideas
                    that I chose to study Computer Science, and my hope is that with attention to my craft I can help to enable such connections.

                    Professionally, I have experience designing, building, and testing CRUD applications built using C#, Windows Forms, and other parts of the .NET Framework for the Automotive Aftermarket.
                    Said applications were written to automate manual data-entry processes involving data encoded in an industry-specific XML format.

                <p>
                    Academically, I have formally studied computer networking, system security, web application development, physical robotics, artificial intelligence, object-oriented programming
                    and modern software development paradigms such as the Agile and Waterfall techniques. I am also one of the lead developers and principal maintainers of the OpenFarm project,
                    which is an open-source platform for managing groups of 3D printers.
