# My Personal Website Skeleton

A simple personal website structure using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, designed with a Skeuomorphic / Frutiger Aero aesthetic.

## Features

*   Basic HTML structure (Header, Nav, Main Content Sections, Footer)
*   CSS styling mimicking Windows Vista/7 UI elements (glossy buttons, gradients, rounded panels).
*   Minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling and dynamic year update.
*   Responsive design adjustments.
*   Ready for GitHub Pages deployment.

## How to Use

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Customize `index.html` with your personal information, projects, and content.
3.  Modify `css/style.css` to tweak the appearance or add more styles.
4.  Add any necessary images (like project screenshots or a background) to the `images/` folder and update paths in the HTML/CSS.
5.  Add more features to `js/script.js` if needed.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `yourusername.github.io` for a user page, or any name for a project page).
2.  Push the files (`index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, `images/`) to the repository's main branch.
3.  Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
5.  Choose the branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the `/ (root)` folder.
6.  Click **Save**.
7.  Your site should be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/` (for user pages) or `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/` (for project pages) after a few minutes.

## Design Notes

*   **Font:** Uses 'Segoe UI' as the primary font, falling back to common sans-serif options.
*   **Colors:** Primarily uses blues, whites, and grays common in the Frutiger Aero theme.
*   **Effects:** Utilizes gradients, box-shadows, text-shadows, border-radius, and RGBA transparency to create the look.

Enjoy customizing!
